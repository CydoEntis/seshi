//! screen: jump, open a folder, new pane, talk, settings and keys.

//! The daemon only knows workspaces, tabs and terminals. Here every terminal is a session;
//! its project and worktree come from where it runs (`TermInfo::root` / `top`), so a shell
//! that `cd`s into another repo moves to that project by itself.
