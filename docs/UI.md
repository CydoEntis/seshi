# UI

This doc covers how the user interface is structured and built.
`AGENTS.md` is the operating contract; this doc holds the UI practices in depth.

**Delete this doc if the project has no user interface,** and remove its row
from `AGENTS.md`. Game menus and HUDs count as a user interface.

## Component structure

```text
components/ui/           primitives: button, input, dialog (design-system level, no domain knowledge)
components/              shared composites used by 2+ features
features/<f>/components/ feature components that know the domain
app/ or routes/          pages/screens: compose features, own layout and routing
```

- Primitives know nothing about the domain. Feature components know nothing
  about routing.
- Keep components small and focused. When one component fetches, transforms,
  and renders, move the fetching and transforming into a hook or service and
  keep the component for rendering.
- Pass data down and events up. Avoid prop drilling deeper than about three
  levels. Composition (`children`, slots) usually solves it before context does.
- Keep business rules out of components. They call feature hooks and services.

## State

| Kind | Examples | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server state | records from the API or database | a query and cache layer, not a global store |
| URL state | filters, tabs, selected id, pagination | the URL, so it survives reload and can be shared |
| Form state | field values, touched, errors | the form library |
| Local UI state | open/closed, hover, draft text | component state |
| Shared UI state | theme, sidebar, current modal | a small store, only when several distant components need it |

- Derive values during render. Don't copy them into state and sync them with
  effects.
- Put state in the lowest component that needs it.

## Async states

Every view that loads data deliberately renders each state that applies:

- **Loading:** a skeleton or spinner that holds the layout, with no content
  jumping when data arrives.
- **Empty:** says what would appear here and, where there is one, the action
  that creates it.
- **Error:** says what failed in plain language and offers a retry. It never
  shows a raw error message.
- **Success.**
- **Partial or stale**, where it applies: refetching and optimistic states.

A mutation shows that it is pending, blocks double submission, and reports the
outcome.

## Forms

- Validate with the same schema the API uses, where possible.
- Show errors next to the field they belong to, after the user interacts with
  it. Show a form-level error for server failures.
- Disable submit while the form is submitting. Keep the user's input when a
  submission fails.

## Accessibility checklist

- The feature works with the keyboard alone, and focus order follows visual
  order.
- Focus is always visible. Dialogs trap focus and return it to the trigger when
  they close.
- Use semantic elements: a `button` for actions and an `a` for navigation. A
  clickable `div` is a defect.
- Every control has an accessible name. Every input has a label.
- Color is never the only signal, and text contrast meets WCAG AA.
- Status and errors are announced without stealing focus.
- Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- The layout works at 200% zoom and at the smallest supported width.

## Styling

- Use design tokens (color, spacing, radius, type scale) rather than hard-coded
  values. A hex color or pixel value in a component is a magic value.
- Build mobile-first, with the project's breakpoints.
- Support light and dark themes through tokens, if the project supports both.

## Performance

- Split code by route. Lazy-load heavy, rarely used views.
- Virtualize long lists.
- Memoize only when there is a measured problem or a clear structural reason.
- Give images explicit dimensions and use modern formats.

## Project-specific: design system

A terminal UI (ratatui). Colours come only from the theme (`theme.rs`): semantic
slots `bg`, `card`, `card2`, `hov`, `accent`/`acc_ink`, `text`/`strong`/`muted`,
and status colours (`working`, `blocked` = needs you, `done`, `idle`, `err`).
Every built-in theme passes a WCAG contrast audit test. Shared primitives in
`client/design.rs` and `client/hydra/`: `panel()` (popup), `fill`, `put`/`seg`
(text runs), `keycap`/`keycaps`, `hints`, `button`, `dim_all`. Icons come from
config (`[icons]`), with Nerd Font glyphs where present.

## Project-specific: layout and navigation

One layout: a sidebar of projects and their sessions (left or right), panes on
the rest (tabs and splits), and a one-line bottom bar. Everything after the leader
key (`Ctrl+Space` by default; keys follow herdr's where they overlap). Popups:
inbox (`j`), command palette (`Space`), keys (`?`), settings (`,`), files, changes,
branches, new agent. Minimum supported size is about
80×24; popups clamp to the screen. Mouse: click, right-click menus, drag
dividers, scroll; Ctrl+click opens paths.

## Project-specific: UI conventions

- Popups are centred `panel()`s with an accent title bar and `Esc close`; the
  screen behind is dimmed.
- Selection = `hov` background and a `›` marker; never the accent colour as a
  row fill.
- Every popup row is clickable and keyboard-reachable; every key is shown as a
  keycap somewhere (hints line, keys screen, palette).
- Short-lived notes are toasts above the bottom bar; destructive actions ask
  first (`Confirm`) and go last in menus.
- Copy is plain words ("Focus the sidebar", not "browse-tree").
